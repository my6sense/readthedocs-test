This document briefly explains how to define the UI of a content-recommendation widget using HTML & CSS.

Custom Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* A Custom Widget is a widget that originates in a (simplified version of a) generic widget, and whose code was edited by the application user.
* Currently, only the classic and infeed families support code customization by the user.
* To switch to code customization mode, select the **Mark widget as custom** option.
* General properties such as number of items in widget and number of paid items can also be edited.
